 
MySensors Nodes
===============

###### *Started ~March 31, 2015*

Some Arduino sketches that use the [MySensors](https://www.mysensors.org/) library to set up a
network of nodes that can be controlled through [Nerve](https://jabberwocky.ca/projects/nerve/).
Most of these were set up around 2015/2016, but I've recently made a simple PCB to replace the
breadboarded versions scattered around my house.
